# Exploitation Evidence

This folder contains **verified, reproducible, and evidence-backed exploitation results** for the vulnerabilities identified during the security assessment.  
Only those vulnerabilities are included here that were:

- Successfully exploited, **OR**
- Demonstrated clear impact through controlled testing  
- Supported with valid screenshots or console output  
- Confirmed through manual verification

This ensures the report remains **authentic, professional, and aligned with real-world VAPT standards**.

## 📌 Included Exploits

### 1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Status: **Successfully Exploited**
- Location: `/TECH/login.php`
- Payload executed inside the browser.
- Demonstrated impact:  
  - Arbitrary JavaScript Execution  
  - Session Hijacking Potential  
  - Data Theft / Account Takeover Risks  
- Screenshot stored in:  
  `screenshots/reflected-xss.jpg`

### 2. Server-Side Injection Attempt
- Status: **Partially Exploited / Confirmed Behavior**
- Server returned a **500 Internal Server Error** when malicious input was injected.
- Indicates:
  - Weak input validation  
  - Backend instability  
  - Potential DoS or deeper injection pathways  
- No screenshot available → **Correctly excluded from screenshot folder**  
- Documented in `exploitation-report.md`

## ❌ Not Included in Exploitation

The following findings **are not exploit-focused** and therefore appear only in vulnerability or mitigation sections:

- SSL misconfigurations  
- Weak security headers  
- Password autocomplete enabled  
- CSP issues  
- Path import warnings  
- Cacheable response  
- Clickjacking indication  

These are **configuration or design issues**, not direct exploit vectors, so they do not belong in this folder.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Folder

This folder is designed to:
- Provide **actual attack demonstrations**  
- Show **clear proof-of-concept (PoC)**  
- Help developers reproduce and fix vulnerabilities  
- Serve as **evidence during audits or interviews**

This aligns with professional VAPT methodology, where **only actionable and reproducible exploits** are documented here.
