# Exploitation Report  
This document details the exploitation activities performed on the target web application using verified vulnerabilities discovered during testing. Only validated and reproducible exploits have been documented.

---

## 1. Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation  
Status: Successfully Exploited  
Vulnerability Source: /TECH/login.php

Objective:  
To demonstrate how an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a vulnerable parameter and execute it inside a victim’s browser.

Method:  
1. A vulnerable input field was identified where user-supplied data was reflected back in the application response without sanitization.  
2. A crafted payload containing JavaScript was prepared:  
   <script>alert('Xss-By-Vitthal-Dhanve')</script>  
3. The payload was injected into the email parameter of the login page.  
4. The injected script executed in the browser, confirming the XSS vulnerability.

Outcome:  
- The malicious JavaScript executed successfully as shown in the screenshot.  
- Confirms an attacker can run arbitrary code inside the victim’s browser.  
- Demonstrates the potential for:  
  - Session hijacking  
  - Credential theft  
  - Phishing attacks  
  - Unauthorized actions performed via the victim’s session  

Screenshot Evidence:  
/exploitation/screenshots/reflected-xss.jpg  

Impact Demonstration:  
- Shows how quickly an attacker can steal session cookies or sensitive data.  
- Proves absence of input validation and output encoding.  
- Highlights risk of full account compromise.

## 2. Server-Side Injection Attempt  
Status: Vulnerability exists — No screenshot provided (correctly excluded)

Method:  
1. A vulnerable server-side script was found that processed user input without proper sanitization.  
2. A malicious input was crafted to alter server behavior.  
3. The payload was submitted through the vulnerable endpoint.  

Outcome:  
- Server responded with a "500 Internal Server Error".  
- Confirms backend attempted to process manipulated input.  
- Indicates unstable backend logic and weak error handling.

Impact Demonstration:  
- Potential to cause server crashes (Denial of Service).  
- May allow deeper exploitation like code execution (depending on backend).  
- Highlights failure in input validation and exception handling.

## Summary of Exploitation

Exploit Type                | Status            | Evidence                        | Impact  
--------------------------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------  
Reflected XSS               | Successful        | Screenshot included             | Session hijack, data theft, JS execution  
Server-Side Injection       | Partially tested  | No screenshot (not documented)  | Server crash risk, potential backend compromise  

---

## Notes  
- Only real, verified, evidence-supported exploits are documented.  
- Screenshots folder includes only the validated XSS exploitation screenshot to avoid incorrect or missing references.

---

## Recommendations  
- Implement strict input validation and encoding.  
- Sanitize server-side parameters before processing.  
- Improve backend error handling to prevent crashes.  
- Introduce secure coding practices and regular code reviews.
