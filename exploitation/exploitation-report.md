# Exploitation of Vulnerabilities  
**Analyst:** Vitthal Dhanve  
**Project:** CyberSentinel – Web Security Analysis  
**Phase:** Exploitation  
**Based ONLY on discovered vulnerabilities and provided exploitation details**

---

# 1️⃣ Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Exploitation

## 🔧 Method (As Provided)
- A vulnerable input field was identified in the web application which **reflected user input directly in the response**.  
- A specially crafted **malicious URL** was created containing a script intended to **steal session cookies**.  
- The crafted URL was **sent to a target user**.  
- When the user clicked the link, the malicious JavaScript **executed inside the victim’s browser**.

---

## 🎯 Outcome (As Provided)
- The malicious script successfully executed.  
- The script **captured the victim’s session cookie**.  
- The stolen cookie was then transmitted to the attacker’s server.  
- Using this cookie, the attacker was able to **hijack the user’s active session**.

---

## 💥 Impact Demonstration (As Provided)
- Demonstrated how easily attackers can steal sensitive information using reflected XSS.  
- Showed that **session hijacking** is possible without user interaction.  
- Highlighted the risk of **unauthorized account access** and **data compromise**.

# 2️⃣ Server-Side Injection Exploitation

## 🔧 Method (As Provided)
- A vulnerable server-side script was found that **executed user input without proper sanitization**.  
- A malicious input containing **additional commands** was created.  
- This input was submitted via the vulnerable endpoint.  
- The server **processed and executed the injected commands**.

---

## 🎯 Outcome (As Provided)
- The vulnerability allowed **arbitrary command execution** on the server.  
- The server’s normal operations were **disrupted** due to the injected commands.  
- As a result, the web application became **unavailable** (downtime).

---

## 💥 Impact Demonstration (As Provided)
- The server was **brought down** as a direct result of the injection attack.  
- Proved that attackers can potentially gain **full control over the server**.  
- Demonstrated severe risks to:  
  - Data integrity  
  - Availability  
  - Overall system stability  

---

# 📌 Conclusion  
This exploitation phase confirms that the identified vulnerabilities can be leveraged to cause **serious damage**:

- **Reflected XSS** → Session theft & unauthorized account access  
- **Server-side injection** → Server disruption & potential full compromise  

These vulnerabilities must be treated as **high priority** and remediated immediately.
