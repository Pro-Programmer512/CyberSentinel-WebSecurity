1. Password Field With Autocomplete Enabled
======================================

Severity: Low  
Confidence: Certain  
Endpoint: /TECH/login.php  

Issue Detail:

Affected Field:

Issue Background:
-----------------
Most browsers can save passwords automatically.  
If autocomplete is enabled, stored credentials may be retrieved by attackers exploiting other vulnerabilities (like XSS).

Remediation:
-------------
- Add `autocomplete="off"` to the form or password field.
- Encourage users to disable password saving in untrusted systems.
