# Vulnerability Scans Overview

This directory contains the complete set of automated and manual vulnerability scan results
generated during the security assessment of the target web application.  
These files provide raw evidence, tool-based outputs, and consolidated summaries that support
the final penetration testing report.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Folder
The goal of this directory is to:
- Store all vulnerability scan outputs in one structured location  
- Provide raw logs and tool evidence for audit and verification  
- Maintain clear documentation that supports the exploitation and final reporting phases  
- Help reviewers quickly understand the overall security posture of the target

## 📘 How These Files Are Used
These scan outputs serve as the foundation for:
- Manual verification  
- Exploitation phase documentation  
- Final security report creation  
- Providing proof-of-findings to industry reviewers or recruiters

If new scans (like Nikto, Dirsearch, or SQLMap) are added in the future, they should also be stored here using the same naming standards.
