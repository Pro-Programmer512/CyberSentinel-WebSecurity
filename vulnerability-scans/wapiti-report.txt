## Key Findings

### 1️⃣ Content Security Policy (CSP) Misconfiguration — **4 instances**
- CSP not properly implemented or missing
- Leaves application vulnerable to XSS and data injection
- Recommendation:
  - Enforce CSP headers with strict `script-src` and `object-src`
  - Disable inline scripts if possible

---

### 2️⃣ Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) — **1 instance**
- User-supplied input not sanitized
- Malicious script execution possible in victim’s browser
- Recommendation:
  - Apply server-side input validation
  - Encode user inputs before rendering
  - Implement strong CSP

---

### 3️⃣ Internal Server Error (500) — **1 instance**
- Server returned an unexpected error for certain requests
- Could expose sensitive server behavior, misconfigurations
- Recommendation:
  - Check backend logs for error source
  - Implement proper exception handling
  - Avoid leaking debug information

---

## Overall Risk Assessment

| Severity  | Count |
|----------|-------|
| High     | 1 (XSS) |
| Medium   | 4 (CSP issues) |
| Low      | 1 (500 Error) |
| Total    | 6 Findings |

## Next Steps
- Validate all Wapiti results manually
- Reproduce XSS manually using Burp Suite
- Review misconfigured CSP headers
- Fix backend errors causing 500 responses
- Add results to the **analysis** and **mitigation** folders
