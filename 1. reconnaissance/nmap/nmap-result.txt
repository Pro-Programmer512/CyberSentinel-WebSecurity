# Nmap Scan Results

## Command Used
nmap -v -A takshyantra.sypoly.org

## Scan Timestamp
May 17, 2024 – 10:30 EAT

---

## Scan Summary
Nmap performed:
- NSE Script Pre-scanning
- Ping Scan
- DNS Resolution
- Connect Scan (1000 ports)
- Service Version Detection
- OS Fingerprinting
- Traceroute

Target:
takshyantra.syploy.org  
IP: 89.117.27.231

---

## Open Ports Detected
1. **21/tcp – FTP**
   - Service detected (details in full output)

2. **3306/tcp – MySQL**
   - Remote database port exposed  
   - Potential for unauthorized access if weak credentials exist

3. **80/tcp – HTTP**
   - Web server running  
   - Likely default Apache/Nginx unless detected otherwise

4. **443/tcp – HTTPS**
   - Secure web service enabled  
   - SSL/TLS configuration needs further analysis

## Key Observations
- Multiple critical services exposed:
  - FTP → often vulnerable to weak credentials
  - MySQL → major risk if remotely accessible
  - HTTP/HTTPS → must be tested for web vulnerabilities (XSS, SQLi, etc.)
- Server responded consistently across scans (no packet filtering)

---

## Recommended Next Steps
- Perform detailed vulnerability scanning on open ports
- Check FTP/MySQL authentication bypass possibilities
- Analyse HTTP/HTTPS with Burp Suite
- Review SSL/TLS configuration
